\subsubsection{Repository across 2 computers}

Relevant StackOverflow \link{https://stackoverflow.com/a/20987150/12374737}{answer}

One might want to develop code on two machines, without using a server such as Github or similar.

Lets say you have created a repository and developed on \tttbf{Computer 1}. That could be only locally or still through some server which you might not want to access through the other computer.

So you have a repository and the working directory on \tttbf{Computer 1}, could also be on \tttbf{Computer 2}, does not matter:

\code{~/<pathToRepo>/<repoName>}

which contains a \code{.git} with all the git related revision history.

Now you want to be able to push to \tttbf{Computer 2}. In order to do that you need

\tttbf{Computer 1:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Normal repository (non-bare) with the working directory
\end{itemize}

\tttbf{Computer 2:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Normal repository (non-bare) with the working directory.
    \item Bare repository
\end{itemize}

The usage will be:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item From \tttbf{Computer 1} working directory: Push to the bare repository on \tttbf{Computer 2}
    \item From \tttbf{Computer 2} working directory: Pull from bare repository on \tttbf{Computer 2}.
\end{enumerate}

or the other way around

\begin{enumerate}
    \item From \tttbf{Computer 2} working directory: Push to the bare repository on \tttbf{Computer 2}.
    \item From \tttbf{Computer 1} working directory: Pull from the bare repository on \tttbf{Computer 2}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsubsection{Instructions}

Lets say you have the original repository with its working directory on \tttbf{Computer 1} with its \code{.git} directory in \code{~/<pathToRepo>/<repoName>/}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \tttbf{Computer 1}: Make a bare clone of the repository with the name extension \code{.git}
    \begin{minted}[]{text}
git clone --bare ~/<pathToRepo>/<repoName> ~/<pathToRepo>/<repoName>.git
    \end{minted}
    
    \item \tttbf{Computer 1}: Copy it over to \tttbf{Computer 2}, using SSH.
    \begin{minted}[]{text}
scp -r ~/<pathToRepo>/<repoName>.git <username>@<ipAddress>:<relativePathBare>
    \end{minted}
    or
    \begin{minted}[]{text}
scp -r ~/<pathToRepo>/<repoName>.git ssh://<username>@<ipAddress>/<fullPathBare>
    \end{minted}

    \item \tttbf{Computer 2}: Clone the bare repository into a non-bare repository.
    \begin{minted}[]{text}
git clone ~/<relativePathBare>/<repoName>.git ~/<pathToStoreRepo>/.
    \end{minted}
\end{enumerate}
