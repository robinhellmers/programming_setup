\subsubsubsection{Test docker connection between distribution and Windows}

Time to test the connection between Windows docker and Ubuntu docker which both runs through WSL2.

In \textbf{Ubuntu terminal}, see which containers that exists:

\code{docker ps -a}

Which should be empty right now.

Open up \code{cmd} in \textbf{Windows} and run \code{hello-world}:

\code{docker run hello-world}

When it is done, see which containers that exists

\code{docker ps -a}

Which should show \code{hello-world} as \code{IMAGE} with a \code{CONTAINER ID}.


Go back to the \textbf{Ubuntu terminal} and see which containers that exists:

\code{docker ps -a}

Which should show \code{hello-world} as \code{IMAGE} with the same \code{CONTAINER ID} as in Windows.
