\subsubsubsection{Fix directory highlight inconsistency}

Depending if you have created the directories within Ubuntu WSL directly with \code{mkdir} or pulled a directory,
which were made within Windows, through some version control system; the background or highlight coloring
of these directory may vary.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Run \code{dircolors -p > ~/.dircolors} and open \code{~/.dircolors} in an editor.
    
    \item Find \code{DIR}, \mintinline{text}{STICKY_OTHER_WRITABLE}, \code{STICKY} and write their corresponding values in the
    comments in case one want to revert the upcoming changes.
    
    \item Find \mintinline{text}{OTHER_WRITABLE} and copy the variable value, which probably is \code{34;42}.
    
    \item Replace the values of \code{DIR}, \mintinline{text}{STICKY_OTHER_WRITABLE}, \code{STICKY} with the copied value of\mintinline{text}{OTHER_WRITABLE}.
    
    \item Restart the Ubuntu terminal.
\end{enumerate}
